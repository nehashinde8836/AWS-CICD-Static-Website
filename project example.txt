Project: CI/CD Pipeline on Cloud – Detailed Example
Scenario / Example

Imagine you’re a developer at a startup building a web application for online notes sharing (like your EngiLearn AI project).

Your team has 5 developers working together.

The app has:

Frontend code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

Backend code (Node.js or Python Flask)

Static assets (images, PDFs)

Currently, your team does manual deployments:

Current Manual Deployment Problems

Manual Build Errors

Developer A pushes code.

Developer B manually copies files to the server.

Sometimes they forget to run npm build → app breaks in production.

Forgotten Tests

Unit tests or integration tests are skipped because nobody ran them.

Bugs go live → users report errors → reputation loss.

Time Consuming

Manual deployment can take 30–60 minutes.

For every new feature or bug fix, the process repeats.

Inconsistent Environments

Local machines might have different versions of dependencies.

Code works locally but fails on the server.

Human Errors

Wrong files uploaded.

Old code overwritten by mistake.

Downtime while deploying.

Solution: Automated CI/CD Pipeline

We build a pipeline that automates everything:

CodeCommit (Code Repository)

All developers push code here.

Acts like GitHub but inside AWS.

CodePipeline (Orchestrator)

Detects when new code is pushed.

Starts the automated build → test → deploy process.

CodeBuild (Automated Build & Test)

Pulls the latest code.

Installs dependencies (npm install / pip install).

Runs tests (npm test / pytest).

Compiles/builds the project.

If tests fail → pipeline stops → developer notified.

Deployment

Option 1: EC2

Deploys backend API or full-stack app to a running EC2 instance.

Example: scp or CodeDeploy pushes code to EC2 automatically.

Option 2: S3

Deploys static frontend (HTML, CSS, JS) to an S3 bucket for a website.

Automatically updates without downtime.

Monitoring & Notifications

Optional: CloudWatch + SNS sends notifications if the pipeline fails.

Pipeline Example Flow

Step-by-step:

Dev pushes new feature to CodeCommit:

git add .
git commit -m "Added new notes upload feature"
git push origin main


CodePipeline detects the change and triggers CodeBuild:

Installs dependencies

Runs tests

Builds the project

Test Results

If a test fails:

Pipeline stops

Developer receives notification

If all tests pass:

Deployment begins automatically

Deployment

Frontend files uploaded to S3 → users immediately see the new feature

Backend code updated on EC2 → API works without downtime

End Result

Automated, fast, error-free deployment

No human errors

Every code change is tested before reaching production

Benefits Compared to Current Manual Process
Current Problems	CI/CD Pipeline Solution
Manual builds → errors	Automated build ensures correct compilation
Tests often skipped	Automated tests prevent buggy code from deploying
Deployment takes long	Instant deployment after tests pass
Human errors	Pipeline is automated → consistent deployments
Different environments	CodeBuild uses consistent cloud environment

💡 In short:
Before CI/CD: Developers manually upload files → high chance of errors → slow releases → frustrated users.
After CI/CD: Developer pushes code → automated build, test, deploy → fast, reliable, consistent updates → happy users.
